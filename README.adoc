A small, fast library for generating cryptographically secure, URL safe IDs.

== Installation

To use this with your Go project:

[source,bash]
----
$ go get github.com/Kaamkiya/nanoid-go
----

== Usage

It's a simple library, and it exports only one function and two constants:

[source,go]
----
const DefaultLength = 22
const DefaultCharset = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890-_"

func Nanoid(length int, charset []string) string
----

To use the defaults:

[source,go]
----
import "github.com/Kaamkiya/nanoid-go"

nanoid.Nanoid(nanoid.DefaultLength, nanoid.DefaultCharset)
----

More complete examples can be found in link:_examples/[``_examples/``].

== Features

* Cryptographically secure - it uses a secure random number generator to make
  the IDs.
* Fast.
* Small - the only import is in the standard library.
* URL safe - it only uses URL safe characters, unless you want it to use more.
